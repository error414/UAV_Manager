# Flight Data Logging with Lua Scripts

With these two Lua scripts, `flylog.lua` and `tellog.lua`, all flight hours and telemetry data can be automatically recorded on the EdgeTX transmitter (TX). The generated logs can then be imported and visualized in the **UAV Manager**.\


GitHub repository for the Lua scripts: [https://github.com/CarviFPV/flylog\_edgetx](https://github.com/CarviFPV/flylog_edgetx)

...... More docs coming soon.....
